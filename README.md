# Car-detection-Cascade-Classifier

在本項練習中，我們利用[1] 中的車輛 cascade classifier 來偵測 台灣國家公園停車場周遭的車輛。

In this practice, we apply the XML file of car cascade classifier from [1] to detect the vehicles on the mountain road. According to [2], it has been stated that Haar-like features were especially targeted to implement face detection. Nevertheless, the framework of cascade classifier with Haar feature can be extened to all-purpose.
