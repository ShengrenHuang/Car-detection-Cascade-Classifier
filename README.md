# Car-detection-Cascade-Classifier


In this practice, we apply the XML file of the car cascade classifier from [1] to detect the vehicles on the mountain road. According to [2], it has been stated that Haar-like features were primarily targeted to implement face detection. Nevertheless, the framework of cascade classifier with Haar feature can be extended to all-purpose. The car cascade classifier was trained using the images taken of the freeway in southern California [1]. The result shows that the vehicles are successfully detected by the algorithm even though the objects are not human faces and the location in the video is not in California.
